<h1>WEEK 0 — SUMaC PREP WELCOME PACKET + SYLLABUS</h1>
<h3>A Friendly Guide to Your 7-Week Journey into Proof-Based Mathematics<br>(Tone D: warm, welcoming, clear, lightly academic)</h3>

<h2>1. Welcome Letter</h2>
<p>Dear SUMaC Applicant,</p>

<p>Welcome to this 7-week guided introduction to the style of mathematics that SUMaC (Stanford University Mathematics Camp) loves: proof-based reasoning, patterns, number theory, and creative problem solving.</p>

<p>This program is designed for students who want to strengthen the exact skills SUMaC looks for — gently, clearly, and without pressure.</p>

<p>You do not need to be an expert in number theory.<br>
You do not need to be an olympiad competitor.<br>
And you do not need years of proof experience.</p>

<p>Most SUMaC students start where you are: strong in math, curious, motivated — but new to formal proofs.</p>

<p>This 7-week program will help you feel confident, capable, and fully prepared to approach the SUMaC application problems with clarity and excitement.</p>

<p>You are absolutely capable of this journey. Let’s begin it together step by step.</p>


<h2>2. What SUMaC Really Expects (In Plain, Friendly Terms)</h2>

<p>SUMaC is not looking for students who already know high-level mathematics such as:</p>

<p>- abstract algebra<br>
- advanced number theory<br>
- analysis<br>
- cryptography<br>
- or Olympiad-level topics</p>

<p>SUMaC is looking for students who:</p>

<p>- think clearly<br>
- write their reasoning step by step<br>
- can follow logical arguments<br>
- can explain why something is true<br>
- enjoy patterns and curious questions<br>
- are willing to explore a new style of math</p>

<p>In other words: SUMaC cares more about mathematical maturity than about prior knowledge.</p>

<p>The application problem set each year is short — usually only 3 to 5 problems. But the solutions require clear structure, reasoning, creativity, and a bit of patience.</p>

<p>This 7-week program is designed to help you build exactly that.</p>


<h2>3. What You Do Not Need to Know (and Why)</h2>

<p>This is important.</p>

<p>SUMaC does not expect you to know:</p>

<p>- deep number theory theorems<br>
- advanced combinatorics<br>
- ring theory<br>
- modular inverses beyond basic concepts<br>
- cryptographic algorithms<br>
- contest-level shortcuts<br>
- complex proofs you’ve never seen</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because SUMaC is meant to teach those things.</p>

<p>What you need is simply:</p>

<p>- the ability to read and write basic proofs<br>
- comfort with small steps and patterns<br>
- a willingness to explore unfamiliar ideas<br>
- algebraic fluency<br>
- careful thinking</p>

<p>This program focuses only on the essentials. Everything else is optional.</p>


<h2>4. The 7-Week Prep Roadmap (Light and Friendly)</h2>

<p>Each week: ~2 hours total. Just enough to grow, not enough to overwhelm.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 0: Welcome Packet + Syllabus</strong><br>
A warm introduction, expectations, study tips.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 1: Proof Bootcamp</strong><br>
What proofs are, and how mathematicians think. Direct proofs, contrapositive, contradiction, induction basics. Light modular arithmetic introduction.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 2: Foundations of Number Theory</strong><br>
Divisibility, remainders, Euclid’s algorithm, modular thinking. Friendly problems with step-by-step guidance.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 3: Modular Arithmetic Essentials</strong><br>
Clock arithmetic, properties, simple linear congruences, patterns. Clear examples and “why this matters” explanations.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 4: Counting &amp; Combinatorics</strong><br>
Combinations, binomial coefficients, patterns in Pascal’s triangle. Puzzle-style problems (fun and non-intimidating).</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 5: Induction &amp; Invariants</strong><br>
Domino-style induction, strong induction, simple invariants, parity patterns. Confidence-building week.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 6: SUMaC-Style Problem Set Training</strong><br>
A gentle introduction to SUMaC application problems: 2 guided problems, 2 independent problems, annotated examples.</p>

<p><strong>WEEK 7: Application Simulation</strong><br>
A friendly mini–SUMaC problem set with full explanations. A confidence check: “Yes, I can really do this.”</p>


<h2>5. The Skills You Will Gain by February</h2>

<p>By the end of these 7 weeks, you will be able to:</p>

<p><strong>Proof &amp; Logic</strong><br>
- Write clear, confident proofs<br>
- Use direct, contrapositive, and contradiction methods<br>
- Apply induction to patterns and formulas</p>

<p><strong>Number Theory</strong><br>
- Understand modular arithmetic (the language of SUMaC Track A)<br>
- Solve simple modular equations<br>
- Use Euclid’s algorithm for greatest common divisors<br>
- Recognize number patterns that appear on SUMaC problems</p>

<p><strong>Combinatorics &amp; Counting</strong><br>
- Work with binomial coefficients<br>
- Use counting strategies in puzzles<br>
- Recognize combinatorial reasoning in proofs</p>

<p><strong>Problem Solving &amp; Communication</strong><br>
- Break down a complex problem into small steps<br>
- Test ideas on small cases<br>
- Write explanations that are clear and readable<br>
- Structure your solutions like a mathematician</p>

<p>These are exactly the skills SUMaC evaluates. And you’ll build them gently, week by week.</p>


<h2>6. How to Study Each Week (Light Weekly Habits)</h2>

<p>This program is designed to fit comfortably into your schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Read the lesson (30–45 minutes)</strong><br>
These lessons are friendly, clear, and designed not to overwhelm you.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Work through guided examples (20–30 minutes)</strong><br>
Examples always show you how to think, not just what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Try the problem set (45–60 minutes)</strong><br>
Problems are intentionally selected to build confidence, not stress.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Reflect for 3 minutes</strong><br>
Ask yourself:<br>
- What made sense?<br>
- What felt confusing?<br>
- What pattern did I notice?</p>

<p>This reflection builds mathematical maturity faster than anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Celebrate small wins</strong><br>
Every new proof is progress. Every pattern recognized is growth.</p>


<h2>7. A Note About Feeling Stuck (Normal + Expected)</h2>

<p>Being “stuck” is not a sign you’re bad at math. It’s actually the main method mathematicians use to learn.</p>

<p>Real mathematicians:</p>

<p>- Try examples<br>
- Make guesses<br>
- Draw diagrams<br>
- Get stuck<br>
- Try again<br>
- And eventually discover a breakthrough</p>

<p>This is normal. Expected. Healthy. Part of the process.</p>

<p>If you feel stuck during any problem in this program: pause, breathe, and try a tiny case.</p>

<p>Often the answer reveals itself through play and curiosity.</p>


<h2>8. Final Encouragement for Your SUMaC Journey</h2>

<p>You are about to start something exciting.</p>

<p>Mathematics in the style of SUMaC is different from typical school math — but it is deeply rewarding. It rewards curiosity, creativity, and clarity rather than speed or memorization.</p>

<p>If you move through these 7 weeks with patience and an open mind, you will arrive at February with genuine confidence:</p>

<p>- You will understand how proofs work<br>
- You will recognize the patterns SUMaC uses<br>
- You will think like a mathematician<br>
- You will be able to communicate your ideas clearly<br>
- You will see math as something alive, not something to fear</p>

<p>Most importantly, you’ll know:<br>
<strong>“I really can do this.”</strong></p>

<p>And you can.</p>

<p>We’re excited for your journey ahead.</p>
